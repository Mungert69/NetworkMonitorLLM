# Docker Setup Instructions

## Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included when you install Docker Desktop. This is the easiest and recommended method to get Docker Compose, which also installs Docker Engine and Docker CLI, necessary for running Compose. Docker Desktop is available for:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

For detailed instructions on installing Docker Desktop, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To set up the Free Network Monitor Agent within Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Docker Compose File**: Create a \`docker-compose.yml\` file with the following content:

\`\`\`yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  networkmonitorprocessor:
    image: mungert/networkmonitorprocessor:latest
    container_name: processor
    user: root
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ~/state/:/app/state/

\`\`\`

**Notes on compose file** For linux host create the folder ~/state. From shell type  mkdir ~/state (this is a linux folder path, adjust acordingly for windows).  


2. **Run Docker Compose**: In the directory where your \`docker-compose.yml\` file is located, run:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`
