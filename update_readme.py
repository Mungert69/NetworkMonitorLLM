## **Choosing the Right Model Format**  

Selecting the correct model format depends on your **hardware capabilities** and **memory constraints**.  

### **BF16 (Brain Float 16) ‚Äì Use if BF16 acceleration is available**  
- A 16-bit floating-point format designed for **faster computation** while retaining good precision.  
- Provides **similar dynamic range** as FP32 but with **lower memory usage**.  
- Recommended if your hardware supports **BF16 acceleration** (check your device‚Äôs specs).  
- Ideal for **high-performance inference** with **reduced memory footprint** compared to FP32.  

üìå **Use BF16 if:**  
‚úî Your hardware has native **BF16 support** (e.g., newer GPUs, TPUs).  
‚úî You want **higher precision** while saving memory.  
‚úî You plan to **requantize** the model into another format.  

üìå **Avoid BF16 if:**  
‚ùå Your hardware does **not** support BF16 (it may fall back to FP32 and run slower).  
‚ùå You need compatibility with older devices that lack BF16 optimization.  

---

### **F16 (Float 16) ‚Äì More widely supported than BF16**  
- A 16-bit floating-point **high precision** but with less of range of values than BF16. 
- Works on most devices with **FP16 acceleration support** (including many GPUs and some CPUs).  
- Slightly lower numerical precision than BF16 but generally sufficient for inference.  

üìå **Use F16 if:**  
‚úî Your hardware supports **FP16** but **not BF16**.  
‚úî You need a **balance between speed, memory usage, and accuracy**.  
‚úî You are running on a **GPU** or another device optimized for FP16 computations.  

üìå **Avoid F16 if:**  
‚ùå Your device lacks **native FP16 support** (it may run slower than expected).  
‚ùå You have memory limitations.  

---

### **Quantized Models (Q4_K, Q6_K, Q8, etc.) ‚Äì For CPU & Low-VRAM Inference**  
Quantization reduces model size and memory usage while maintaining as much accuracy as possible.  
- **Lower-bit models (Q4_K)** ‚Üí **Best for minimal memory usage**, may have lower precision.  
- **Higher-bit models (Q6_K, Q8_0)** ‚Üí **Better accuracy**, requires more memory.  

üìå **Use Quantized Models if:**  
‚úî You are running inference on a **CPU** and need an optimized model.  
‚úî Your device has **low VRAM** and cannot load full-precision models.  
‚úî You want to reduce **memory footprint** while keeping reasonable accuracy.  

üìå **Avoid Quantized Models if:**  
‚ùå You need **maximum accuracy** (full-precision models are better for this).  
‚ùå Your hardware has enough VRAM for higher-precision formats (BF16/F16).

### **Summary Table: Model Format Selection**  

| Model Format  | Precision  | Memory Usage  | Device Requirements  | Best Use Case  |  
|--------------|------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|  
| **BF16**     | Highest       | High      | BF16-supported GPU/CPUs  | High-speed inference with reduced memory |  
| **F16**      | High     | High           | FP16-supported devices | GPU inference when BF16 isn‚Äôt available |  
| **Q4_K**     | Low        | Very Low      | CPU or Low-VRAM devices | Best for memory-constrained environments |  
| **Q6_K**     | Medium Low     | Low      | CPU with more memory | Better accuracy while still being quantized |  
| **Q8**       | Medium       | Moderate        | CPU or GPU with enough VRAM | Best accuracy among quantized models |

### What I'm Testing

I'm experimenting with **function calling** against my network monitoring service. Using small open source models. I am into the question "How small can it go and still function".

üü° **TestLLM** ‚Äì Runs the current testing model using llama.cpp on 6 threads of a Cpu VM (Should take about 15s to load. Inference speed is quite slow and it only processes one user prompt at a time‚Äîstill working on scaling!). If you're curious, I'd be happy to share how it works! .

### The other Available AI Assistants

üü¢ **TurboLLM** ‚Äì Uses **gpt-4o-mini** Fast! . Note: tokens are limited since OpenAI models are pricey, but you can [Login](https://freenetworkmonitor.click) or [Download](https://freenetworkmonitor.click/download) the Free Network Monitor agent to get more tokens, Alternatively use the FreeLLM .

üîµ **FreeLLM** ‚Äì Runs **open-source Hugging Face models** Medium speed (unlimited, subject to Hugging Face API availability).
