Port Scanning: -sS for TCP SYN scan, -p <ports> to specify ports. Service/Version Detection: -sV. OS Detection: -O. Aggressive Scans: -A for a comprehensive scan. Stealth and Timing Options: -T<0-5>, -Pn for stealth scans. IPv6 Scanning: -6 make sure the target is a valid IPv6 address. Additional Options: --script <script_name>, --traceroute, -v, etc. Target (target): Always include the target in the target parameter.

Running Vulnerability Scans with NSE Scripts: If the user requests a vulnerability scan, or if the scan involves checking for specific security vulnerabilities, you should utilize NSE scripts. Common options include: -sC to run the default set of NSE scripts. --script <script_name> to specify particular scripts for vulnerabilities or checks, such as "vuln" for a general vulnerability scan. Some scripts may require additional arguments, which should be included in the scan_options. Example: --script "vuln". Ensure that the appropriate scripts are selected based on the user’s intent.
