Close the browser window once you receive a message confirming your agent is authenticated.

3. **Login to Free Network Monitor**: Click this task to be redirected to the [Free Network Monitor Dashboard](https://freenetworkmonitor.click/dashboard). Login with the same email address you used for agent authorization. This is where you'll manage your network monitoring.

4. **Adding Hosts**: After logging into the Free Network Monitor site, navigate to the dashboard. To add a host for monitoring, click the flashing edit icon. For instance, to monitor a local router, input its IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and select 'icmp' as the endpoint type. This action enables you to ping the router, monitoring its availability.

5. **Select Monitor Location**: You have the option to choose between predefined remote agents or your local agent for monitoring purposes. For local devices like a router at 192.168.1.1, select 'your email address - agent id' as the monitor location.

6. **View and Edit Mode**: Utilize the edit icon to switch between view and edit modes. In view mode, monitoring data for hosts will appear after about 2 minutes. Click the chart icon next to a host for more detailed response data.

7. **Alerts and Reports**: Receive email alerts if a host is detected as down, along with weekly reports that analyze your hosts' performance. It's necessary to verify your email address to receive these alerts and reports. If the verification email doesn't arrive, make sure to whitelist support@mahadeva.co.uk in your spam filter.

8. **Account Management**: Manage your account by clicking the profile icon.

**View Monitoring Data**: You have two options for viewing detailed monitoring data. You can use the Free Network Monitor Dashboard or the Agent App, which displays current monitoring data for each dataset (6-hour set of response data).

- **Using the Free Network Monitor Dashboard**: Access the dashboard to view comprehensive monitoring data and analyses. 

- **Using the Agent App**: To view data in the app, return to the Agent App and navigate to the Data tab. Here, monitoring data is visually represented:
    - **Indicator Circles**: Each host is indicated by a circle, which will appear green or red based on the host's current status.
    - **Click on the Circle**: For more detailed monitoring information, click on the circle representing a host.
    - **Pulsing Circles**: A pulsing circle indicates that the host is up. The rate of pulsing reflects the response time - faster pulsing signifies quicker response times.
    - **The Purple Beacon Effect**: This effect shows the percentage of successful responses. A smaller circle indicates a lower success rate, visually representing the reliability of each host.

By providing these visual cues and interactive elements, users can quickly ascertain the health and performance of their monitored hosts at a glance, enhancing the user experience with intuitive navigation and real-time insights.


# Docker Setup Instructions

## Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included when you install Docker Desktop. This is the easiest and recommended method to get Docker Compose, which also installs Docker Engine and Docker CLI, necessary for running Compose. Docker Desktop is available for:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

For detailed instructions on installing Docker Desktop, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To set up the Free Network Monitor Agent within Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Docker Compose File**: Create a \`docker-compose.yml\` file with the following content:

\`\`\`yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  networkmonitorprocessor:
    image: mungert/networkmonitorprocessor:latest
    container_name: processor
    user: root
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ~/state/:/app/state/

\`\`\`

**Notes on compose file** For linux host create the folder ~/state. From shell type  mkdir ~/state (this is a linux folder path, adjust acordingly for windows).  


2. **Run Docker Compose**: In the directory where your \`docker-compose.yml\` file is located, run:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`

## Authorizing the Agent

Unlike the app version, the Docker version of the Free Network Monitor Agent requires manual authorization:

1. **Start the Authorization Process**: After starting the Docker container, use the following command to view the logs:

\`\`\`bash
docker logs processor -f
\`\`\`

2. **Retrieve the Authorization URL**: Look for a log entry similar to the following:

\`\`\`
https://authnew.freenetworkmonitor.click:2096/oauth2/device?client_id=de064977-4bde-4426-81f7-4354041fe58b&tenantId=a4d7499b-557c-d132-7d6f-0a575402a781&user_code=2PBLYP
\`\`\`

Copy and paste this URL into a web browser to start the authentication process.

3. **Complete the Authentication**: Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your account or create a new one.

4. **Verify Successful Authorization**: Check the Docker logs for a success message like the following:

\`\`\`
MessageAPI : SetAuthKey :  SetAuthKey :  Success : Set AuthKey and saved NetConnectConfig to appsettings.json
\`\`\`

## Adding Hosts for Monitoring

Once the agent is authorized, you can start adding hosts to monitor:

1. **Monitor Hosts**: Add hosts to monitor via the Free Network Monitor Service dashboard at [https://freenetworkmonitor.click/dashboard](https://freenetworkmonitor.click/dashboard). Login with the same email address you used to authorize the agent.

2. **Adding Hosts**: Once logged into the Free Network Monitor site, go to the dashboard and add a host that you want to monitor, click the flashing edit icon. You might wish to monitor a local router at the IP address 192.168.1.1 using the endpoint type 'icmp' to ping the local router, thereby monitoring its availability.

3. **Select Monitor Location**: You can choose either predefined remote agents or your local agent. However, for monitoring local devices like a router at 192.168.1.1, you would need to choose 'your email address - agent id' when selecting a monitor location.

4. **View and Edit Mode**: Click the edit icon to toggle between view and edit modes. In view mode, after about 2 minutes, host monitoring data should start appearing. For detailed response data, click the chart icon next to the host.

5. **Alerts and Reports**: Alerts will be sent to your email address if the host is detected as down. Weekly reports are also sent to your email address with an analysis of your hosts' performance. Note that you must verify your email address to receive email alerts and reports. If you don't receive the verification email, exclude support@mahadeva.co.uk from your spam filter.

6. **Account Management**: You can manage your account by clicking the profile icon.



**View Log Entries**: To verify that hosts are being added successfully, check the Docker logs for entries like:

\`\`\`
MessageAPI : ProcessorQueueDic :  AddMonitorIPsToQueueDic :  Success : Added 1 MonitorIPs Queue .
\`\`\`
